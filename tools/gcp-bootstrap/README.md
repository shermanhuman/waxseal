# GCP bootstrap (waxseal)

Deprecated: the v1 plan removes repo scripts for bootstrap.

Use the cross-platform Go command instead:

- `waxseal gcp bootstrap` (implemented in Go; shells out to `gcloud` which must already be installed and authenticated)

The canonical behavior and flags live in the planning docs under `.plan/`.
